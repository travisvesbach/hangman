Notes:  Overall, this project was a lot of fun.  The most difficult part was figuring out how JSON works.  Though I still don't fully understand it and what can all be done, I was able to get the basics and have it working effectively.  One thing that I would like to learn and come back and add is how to make multiple saves with JSON.  I know how I can make it work with multiple .json files, but I would like to know to store multiple saves in one .json file.
